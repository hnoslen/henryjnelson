Welcome to my home page. This page is mainly for me to keep&nbsp; track
of my hobbies and maybe informally publish some things, but go ahead
and look around. Hopefully our interests will match in at least one
area and you can have a good time and maybe learn something along the
way.<br>
<br>
Below are some general notes about a few things on this site.<br>
<br>
<h2>Denoting Dates 2016-2-19</h2>

I REALLY REALLY REALLY dislike the date standard in the US. It makes no
sense. For those of you who don't know, in the US dates are commonly
denoted as Month-Day-Year (MDY) while most of the rest of the world
uses something like Day-Month-Year (DMY) or Year-Month-Day (YMD), but I
guess we just have to be unique don't we (like still using imperial
units, but that's another rant in itself). Both of the more common
formats keeps the progression of time intervals consistant as they are
always increasing or decreasing in delimeter while the MDY format seems
to skip all over. As you may have notived, on this site I subscribe to
the YMD format which I also use in my daily life. The increasing
specificity of this format are perfect for recording data in a file
structure while the decreasing specificity of DMY requires an extra
step of reading right to left (this may be more useful for you if your
native language reads right to left).<br>

<br>

As for the debate between using a two digit year or four digit year,
the four digit format is far superior. There is already an ambiguity
between the day and month if the day is 12 or less and adding another
two digit number to this just increases the confusion as to which
format is being used. As for the seperators between the numbers,
clarity is the main issue. The slash (/), period (.), and space ( )
dont give much indication and can easily be misread. For this reason I
usually go for the hyphen (-) which is not easily mistaken for a number
like "/" or too small to be visible like a period or space.<br>
