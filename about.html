<h2 style="text-align: left;">About Me<br>
</h2>

Hello, my name is Henry J. Nelson and I'm an undergraduate physics and
math major at a small liberal arts college. I really enjoy working on
almost anything in the above catagories. There is always something that
I'm working on so I thought I'd make a place where I could share all
the ongoing and completed projects to better improve my book-keeping
and maybe help someone else out in the process.&nbsp; Hopefully you
will find something that's interesting and educational. This site is my
current project and hopefully it will improve as time goes on and I
learn what I'm doing better, so hopfully the building of this site will
be somewhere on this site if you want to try something similar.<br>

<br>

Below I will talk a little about my background in each area of the site
so you can maybe get up to speed if you don't understand something by
using the resources I did. I will try and make everything accessable to
a beginner&nbsp; in whatever we're doing as that's usually where I am,
but at some point everyone gets lost so don't be afraid to learn on
your own from other sources.<br>

<h2>Physics</h2>

My physics background is easily reproducible. When I was young, I loved
all things science-fiction. At some point I recieved the book "The
Physics of Star Trek" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss" target="_blank">Lawrence
M. Krauss</a> and it blew my mind. Many things in the magical stories
of Star Trek we actually possible! This book also gave me my first
glance at the more interesting facets of physics like reletivity and
quantum mechanics getting me hooked on the magical nature of
the world. From there I consumed everything about physics that was
produced for a popular audience. I loved watching Nova and Scientific
American Frontiers as well as reading popular science books like "Six
Easy Pieces" which are excerpts from the Feynman Lectures on Physics
and "Alice in Quantumland" which are both very understandable for a
novice and I highly recommend them. After that I finally got to a point
in school where I could take physics classes and I took a general
physics course and a very short introductory class into particle
physics. After that I started college and started moving into higher
levels, but hopefully most of the concepts should still be graspable
(maybe not the math, but the general intuition at least).<br>

<br>

<h2>Math Background</h2>

I always sucked at math. My school always did the seperate classes for
students based on test scores (MAPs or MCAs or something), so needless
to say I was always in the lowest teir math class. I don't know how it
happened, but between grades 5 and 6, I moved from the lowest level
math class to the highest and ended up struggling quite a bit to keep
up. But I persevered and made it through the rest of my schooling
unimpeded by math. After getting to college math became the perfect
tool for my other passions like physics and the theoretical computer
science so I continued taking classes. When I finally got to the higher
levels of mathematics (Cobinatorics,Graph Theory, and Abstract Algebra)
math started to be incredibly cool not just as a tool, but also for
itself. At this point I now love math and the wonderfully logical
arguments used in proofs, but I still suck at it. I just suck at a
higher lever of math now.<br>

<br>

<h2>Computer Science Background</h2>

My computer science knowledge has definitly had the fastest growth of
any of my abilities. Just a few years ago I knew nothing about tech
except maybe how to hook up a tv. About the time I was a teenager, my
friends and classmates started having an iPod Touch or something
similar, so I had to have one too.&nbsp; But for some reason I had an
aversion to Apple and ended up buying myself a Nokia N900 (which had
many more features than the iPod Touch). The N900 had Maemo as its
operating system which was a linux variant. Pretty soon I was playing
around with the terminal and built-in programming suite and writing
simple programs. I originally just typed in what I wanted to happen and
found that in many instances it would just work (later I found this was
the user friendlyness of Python). Once I learned how versitile Python
was I took the Udacity mooc, Introduction to Computer Science, which
gave me a good basis. From there I started working on more complicated
programs eventually moving to programming with the Raspberry Pi. As I
tried to do more applied programming projects it was necessary to learn
other languages like C/C++, Java, and Matlab. All of these I learned on
my own using the vast resources online. Specifically C/C++ and Java can
be learned from almost any of the online sources. For Matlab I
recommend reading through the wonderful documentation that comes with
it.<br>

<br>

<h2>Philosophy Background</h2>

I have only taken a few introductory philosophy courses in college so
there should be no danger to you falling behind here. To me, the
biggest part of philosophy is logic so as long as you can keep up with
basic logic you should be fine.<br>

<br>

<h2>Movies and TV&nbsp;</h2>

There are way too many movies and tv shows for me to list everything
I've seen, so suffice it to say I've seen a lot. As I mentioned before,
I believe Star Trek has had a large impact on my life, but any other
relevant things I will hopfully list when I need to refeferace them so
I don't fill up the internet.<br>

<br>

<h2>Professional Background<br>
</h2>

I have previously worked as a research assistant in a graduate
scientific computing lab for two summers working on both machine
learning techniques and optimization problems and in a VA medical
research lab writing software to interface with medical equipment and
developing virtual reality systems for medical testing.<br>
