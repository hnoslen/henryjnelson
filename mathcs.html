<h2>Building a Website</h2>

This section should document how this site was built. To start you
should know a little html/css and a Google supported programming
language (Python, Java, Go, PHP). If you don't know html and css, I
encourage you to (on Mozilla or Chrome) right-click a page and
"View-source" which lets you see the code used to generate the page. In
most cases this will be a combination of html, javascript, and css but
some of the older-looking sites (like this one) contain just html and
css. You only really need html if you want to be bare bones but css
makes your life easier. You should be able to get a general idea of how
html works by looking at a couple of different sites and there are alot
of html tutorial sites that are very good if you get stuck.<br>

<br>

This site is built using Google AppEngine that is running the Python
framework Webapp2. Webapp2 is a Python library made for making webapps
quickly and easily.&nbsp; Since webapp2 is made specifcally for webapps
and specializes in dynamic contect that is generated after the server
recieves a request, most of its functionality will not be used for a
static (site with constant content) like this one. The first thing we
need to do is write our content. This can be done in any text editor,
just make sure you name the file something ending with ".html" so you
will be able to open it with your web-browser to check your progress. <br>

<br>

After we've created our static content we need to create handlers in
our .yaml file and our Python script. I cannot stress how good the
Google AppEngine tutorials are for this. After handling these, we now
add any dynamic pages to our python script. The only dynamic page of
this site right now is the contact page and the ideas page which is
built to take input
from the user.<br>

<br>

All the code for this site is available on <a href="https://github.com/hnoslen/henryjnelson" target="_blank">Github</a>
if you'd like to take a look. <br>

<h2>A Reinforcement Learning Framework</h2>

I looked for a while for a good framework for reinforcement learning
but was unsatisfied with the results. While there are some out there
(not many), most seemed to have a large learning curve and be in Java
instead of nice language for development. I started making one myself
in Python, to learn more about it and for fun. <br>
